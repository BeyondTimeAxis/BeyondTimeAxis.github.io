|	IV. TRANSLATION NOTES		|
-----------------------------------------

[1] The original subtitle of the game, Gyakusen Saiban means "Judgment of Cruel Battle" or "Trial by Ordeal". A more literal translation could also be "Massacre Trial".  I decided to go with "Ace Attornauts" as the title for the translated version after considering several other options, such as "Judgment Clash," and "Verdict Vanguard." In the end, "Ace Attornauts" just had the best ring to it.

[2] Masashi and Maya refer to Ryuichi as "Ryu-kun". I've shortened this to just "Ryu".

[3] Chihiro's Legalink Address, 416, is a Goroawase wordplay. Japanese numbers can be read in multiple different ways, and a goroawase number breaks up the syllables of a word or name and associates them with the  number that matches them the closest. For Chihiro's, it is Chi(4)-Hi(1)-Ro(6).  Many of the other characters' numbers are goroawase as well. For example, Rei(0)-Ji(2)-Mitsu(3) for Reiji.

[4] Character Name Readings:

|	V. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS	|
-----------------------------------------

Q. What was Kojima smoking when he made this?
A. Don't ask me. Back during the Konami and Capcom merger, there was apparently a project in the works at capcom about lawyers, which is where a lot of the core concepts came from, and it got handed off to Kojima midway through. When asked about it, he said this is what he imagined the legal system would look like if humanity went to space. Everyone has just learned not to question him.

Q. I saw a more lanky and goofy design for Masashi in the GS Design Works book. Why's he so buff?
A. I'm guessing they wanted the mentor character to look more capable. He probably would have been a very different charater if they went with the old design.

Q. How does this take place in 202X?
A. Back in the 90s, people thought technology would keep getting better exponentially. George Jetson of The Jetsons was born in 2022. It's best if you just don't think too hard about it, or think of it as an alternate history. But who knows, as of the time of this translation's release, there are still at least 6 more years left in the 2020s, so there's still time for all of this to happen.

Q. How did Ryuichi not know that Trials were determined by Giant Robots, despite having spent a year learning how to pilot a giant robot?
A. Aside from Ryuichi being a little dense, nobody ever explicitly told him. They all just thought it was obvious. And the simulators use more minimalist polygonal graphics, so he didn't really know what to expect.  He knew Barristers existed, of course, but he thought they were for military purposes.  He suspected the simulators had something to do with Barristers, but figured it was just Masashi bringing his own personal flair and experience into the training.  As for how he became registered to become an Attornaut, it's such an unpopular job that there are no real barriers to entry. Anyone can sign up for it and get the job with little to no skills or experience. Whether they'll actually get hired by anyone is a different story, but with Masashi's recommendation, he was able to get connected with Chihiro, who saw potential in him.

Q. I still don't understand what an Attornaut is . . .
A. Simple answer: an attorney in space who moonlights as a mecha pilot. Long answer: A company called Bluecorp hires people interested in becoming Attornauts, and trains them to pilot Barristers. Chihiro acts as their agent, assigning them to clients. There are independent attornauts that can be hired directly as well, but unless they're very famous, most will be hired through an intermediary like Chihiro. Prosecuting attornauts are hired by the colony's government and considered part of the police force, and by extension the military. Defense Attornauts are sometimes contracted for police and military matters as well, albeit rarely. More details, including how things ended up this way, are provided as the story goes on.

|	VII. SPECIAL 			|
-----------------------------------------
Okay, time to lift the veil a little bit here. Obviously I did not partner up with Hideo Kojima to make this project. This was an entry for the "Into the Takumi-verse" competition hosted by Samallama & DeathByAutoscroll. It started off as me thinking "what would Ace Attorney look like if Takumi were swapped out with someone else?"  I went with Kojima, and thought about the idea of making it similar to Kojima's 1994 Adventure Game "Policenauts".  This is kind of like a weird alternate universe where Konami and Capcom had a merger while Policenauts was in development, and the ace attorney team (besides Takumi who wasn't involved with the project) got subsumed into that project and turned it into something new.

As far as the characters went, my approach was to think of them as if Kojima had access to some concept art and notes originally planned for Ace Attorney, and ended up just going nuts with them. Which bits of lore, names, or personality I would keep basically just depended on my own preference. For one, Ryuichi is a fair bit younger, less mature, and a lot more of a weirdo in this. This was inspired a lot by adventure game protagonists who often need something silly to say about every little thing in the environment. Characters like Jonathan Ingram or Kaname Date. Making the main character weird just makes it a lot more fun to interact with things. The decision to visually examine the characters was also taken from many older Japanese PC-98 adventure games. It's a silly feature, so I tried to use it mainly for silliness, as well as a bit of character and worldbuilding. For Chihiro, a lot of her personality was inspired by characters like Boss from AI: The Somnium Files, and a lot of similar PC-98 adventure game characters. I could spell out other ways the characters differ from their original counterparts, but figuring that out is part of the fun. Just don't take anything you think you know about a character for granted. They are basically new characters wearing skinsuits of their originals.

The PC-98 aesthetic was difficult to pull off, and to be honest, I'm not fully happy with how it turned out, since the AA-style art doesn't necessarily lend itself well to that style. Obviously the visuals don't adhere to PC-98 color palette rules perfectly. I experimented with some that did and they ended up looking awful. They would need to be designed from the ground up with that in mind for them to work well, but I didn't have the time or energy to draw new art for every single character (although I pretty much did for some of them), as well as drawing entirely new backgrounds that would fit the character palettes, so I tried to make do with what I could.

For those unfamiliar with Policenauts, it actually has almost nothing in common with this project in its current form, aside from the name being an homage and it being set in space. It's about a detective who investigates space crimes. A common hallmark of Kojima games is the bizarre fusion of wacky borderline nonsensical antics, and relatively serious political intrigue. I tried to maintain somewhat of a presense for both of those elements at least. After some fleshing out, this idea of mine morphed from "Kojima makes Ace Attorney" into the Kojima influence just being a small part of it, with the focus shifting primarily to the mecha aspect. I started putting a lot of my soul into this project and making it about everything that I love. When you're as antisocial as me, that can sometimes backfire, and I knew full well that the venn diagram of Ace Attorney fans and hardcore mecha fans had very little overlap.  In the end, the strongest influence on this project is probably the Super Robot Wars series. It's actually hard to go 5 minutes in this case without stumbling upon a very unsubtle reference to some mecha or sci-fi anime or another. Some things are considered a "love letter to a genre", but this is more like "standing outside the genre's window with a boombox." I'm sure people who wanted more of a mystery focus will be disappointed, but maybe this will serve as a gateway drug to indoctrinate some AA fans into the mecha genre.  At the very least, I hoped it could capture the feeling of playing a silly 90s PC-Engine adventure game.
